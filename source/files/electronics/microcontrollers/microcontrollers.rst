Microcontrollers
================
A microcontroller or microcontroller unit (MCU) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit. 
A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.

Arduino
=======
Arduin1 is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.


ESP8266
=======
The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller, with built-in TCP/IP networking software, and microcontroller capability, 
produced by Espressif Systems in Shanghai, China


ESP32
=====
ESP32 is a series of low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth, 
produced by Espressif Systems in Shanghai, China.
ESP32 is a successor of the ESP8266 microcontroller.
ESP32 is a dual-core 160MHz to 240MHz CPU, whereas the ESP8266 is a single-core processor that runs at 80MHz. Both CPUs are 32-bit.
