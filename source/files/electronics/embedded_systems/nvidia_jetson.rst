=============
NVIDIA Jetson 
=============
Nvidia Jetson is a series of embedded computing boards from Nvidia.
Jetson devices carry a Tegra SoC from Nvidia that integrates an ARM architecture CPU and a GPU.

Jetson is a low-power system and is designed for accelerating machine learning applications

Tools
=====

* ``nvidia-smi`` - NVIDIA System Management Interface program. Provides monitoring and management capabilities for NVIDIA GPUs (not available on Jetson devices)

* ``jetson-stats`` (command ``jtop``) - A package to monitor and control your NVIDIA Jetson [Xavier NX, Nano, AGX Xavier, TX1, TX2] embedded board. 
  It is a collection of various tools to monitor the system, including CPU, GPU, and RAM usage, temperature, and power consumption.
  `Repository <https://github.com/rbonghi/jetson_stats>`_

* ``prime-select`` - Command-line tool to switch between Intel and NVIDIA graphics cards on Ubuntu (on hybrid systems)

* ``nvidia-settings`` - GUI tool to configure the NVIDIA graphics driver

* ``glxinfo | grep "OpenGL renderer"`` - to check the OpenGL renderer (to make sure the NVIDIA GPU is being used)
  (install: ``sudo apt install mesa-utils``)
  
  - ``glxinfo -B`` - to get more detailed information about 3D acceleration setup


Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX Setup
=============================

1. Install Nvidia SDK Manager on your host machine. NB! Xavier NX requires a host machine with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (not newer)
   Latest supported JetPack version is 5.1.4
   Easiest way to use SDK Manager in a Docker container. It can be downloaded `here <https://developer.nvidia.com/sdk-manager>`_ NB! Use image Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04

2. NB! When installing JetPack SDK using the SDK Manager Docker image install ``qemu-user-static`` and ``binfmt-support`` on the host,
   Then run following commands: ``sudo update-binfmts --enable`` and ``sudo killall adb``

3. Load the docker image: ``docker load -i ./sdkmanager-[version].[build#]-[base_OS]_docker.tar.gz``,
   Then tag the image: ``docker tag sdkmanager:[version].[build#] sdkmanager:latest``

4. Run the Docker image: ``docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /dev/bus/usb:/dev/bus/usb/ -v /dev:/dev -v /media/$USER:/media/nvidia:slave
   sdkmanager --cli``

5. When ready to flash, connect Jetson's pins 9 and 10 to boot into force recovery mode. Connect Jetson to host via a USB cable. Turn on the Jetson.

6. After flash is completed, remove the jump wire and reboot Jetson.

.. note::
   If SDK Manager can't detect Jetson, even though it is showing up on both host and inside the container when running ``lsusb``, try to do step 5 before running Docker.
