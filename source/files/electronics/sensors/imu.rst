IMU
===
IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is a sensor that measures acceleration (by accelerometer) and angular velocity (by gyroscope) 
and sometimes magnetic field (by magnetometer).

IMU is used in drones, robots, and other devices to estimate the orientation.

It is worth noting that IMU provides relative positioning information. Its function is to measure the route of the object relative 
to the starting point, so it cannot provide information about your specific location. Therefore, it is often used together with GPS. 
When the GPS signal is weak in some places, IMU can play its role, allowing the car to continue to obtain absolute position 
information so as not to get lost.
