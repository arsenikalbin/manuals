GPS (Global Positioning System) is a satellite-based navigation system that provides location and time information 
anywhere on or near the Earth where there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or more GPS satellites. 
The system is operated by the United States government and is freely accessible to anyone with a GPS receiver.

GPS works by using a network of satellites that orbit the Earth. 

#. These satellites continuously transmit signals that contain the satellite's position and the precise time the signal was transmitted. 

#. A GPS receiver on the ground or in a vehicle picks up these signals from multiple satellites and uses the timing information to calculate 
   its distance from each satellite based on the time it took for the signals to arrive. 
  
#. By combining distance measurements from multiple satellites, the GPS receiver can determine its own three-dimensional position (latitude, longitude, and altitude) 
   as well as the precise time.

It has become an essential tool for navigation, mapping, tracking, and timing synchronization in many industries and everyday activities.


GPS systems consists of three main components:

1. Space Segment: The space segment consists of a constellation of satellites that orbit the Earth and continuously transmit signals.
2. Control Segment: The control segment consists of ground stations that monitor and control the satellites, ensuring they are functioning properly and providing accurate data.
3. User Segment: The user segment consists of GPS receivers that receive and process the signals from the satellites to determine their own position and time.
