Motor Encoder
=============
Motor Encoders in their simplest form, motor encoders are electromechanical devices that turn mechanical motion into an electrical signal. 
The output signal can either be a series of pulses, an analog (a.k.a. sine-cosine) signal, digital signal, or converted to a 
communication bus. The signal is sent to a servo drive that will translate that signal into position and velocity values
