Modbus
======
Modbus or MODBUS is a client/server data communications protocol in the application layer. It was originally published by 
Modicon (now Schneider Electric) in 1979 for use with its programmable logic controllers (PLCs). Modbus has become a de facto 
standard communication protocol for communication between industrial electronic devices in a wide range of buses and network.


S7 Communication (S7comm)
=========================
S7 is a proprietary communication protocol developed by Siemens. It is used for communication between Siemens PLCs and other
Siemens devices. It is not an open protocol and is not used outside of Siemens devices.

It is used for PLC programming, exchanging data between PLCs, accessing PLC data from SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) 
systems and diagnostic purposes. It is application layer protocol that runs on top of TCP/IP.
