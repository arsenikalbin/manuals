OSI model
=========
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or 
computing system into seven abstraction layers. 

A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. 
For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a network provides the path needed by applications above it, 
while it calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that make up the contents of that path.
