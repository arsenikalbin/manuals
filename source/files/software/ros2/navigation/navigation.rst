Nav2
====
Nav2 is the professionally-supported successor of the ROS Navigation Stack deploying the same kinds of technology 
powering Autonomous Vehicles brought down, optimized, and reworked for mobile and surface robotics. This project allows 
for mobile robots to navigate through complex environments to complete user-defined application tasks with nearly 
any class of robot kinematics. Not only can it move from Point A to Point B, but it can have intermediary poses, and 
represent other types of tasks like object following, complete coverage navigation, and more. 

Nav2 is a production-grade and high-quality navigation framework trusted by 100+ companies worldwide.
