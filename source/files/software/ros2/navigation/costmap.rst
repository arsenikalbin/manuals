=======
Costmap
=======
A costmap is a representation of the robot environment that assigns a cost value to each cell 
based on the occupancy, obstacle distance, inflation radius, and other factors


Costmap 2D (ROS package)
========================
The Costmap 2D package implements a 2D grid-based costmap for environmental representations and a 
number of sensor processing plugins (AI outputs, depth sensor obstacle buffering, semantic information, etc)


OctoMap
=======
The OctoMap library implements a 3D occupancy grid mapping approach, providing data structures and 
mapping algorithms in C++ particularly suited for robotics. The map implementation is based on an octree.
