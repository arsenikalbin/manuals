Object Detection
================
is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of  semantic objects of  
a certain class in digital images and videos.

Object detection is an extension of image classification. It not only tells us if a certain object is present in the picture,
but also tells us where. Comparing to Classification with Localization, object detection can detect multiple objects in an image.
