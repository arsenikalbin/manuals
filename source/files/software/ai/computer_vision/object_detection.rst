Object Detection
================
is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of  semantic objects of  
a certain class in digital images and videos.

Object detection is an extension of image classification. It not only tells us if a certain object is present in the picture,
but also tells us where. Comparing to Classification with Localization, object detection can detect multiple objects in an image.

* Edge Impulse FOMO (Faster Objects, More Objects) is a novel machine learning algorithm that brings object detection to highly constrained 
  devices which lets you count multiple objects and find their location in an image in real-time using up to 30x less processing power 
  and memory than MobileNet SSD or YOLOv5. `Link <https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/edge-impulse-studio/learning-blocks/object-detection/fomo-object-detection-for-constrained-devices>`_
