Reinforcement Learning
======================
Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning that allows the agent to learn from its environment by interacting with it. 
The agent learns to perform tasks by being rewarded or penalized for its actions. The goal of reinforcement learning is to 
find the best policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

Policy
======
A policy is a strategy that an agent uses in pursuit of goals. The policy dictates the actions that the agent takes as a 
function of the agent's state and the environment
