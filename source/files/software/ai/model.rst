Machine Learning Models
=======================

**Architecture** of a Machine Learning Model is a structure that can be trained to recognize patterns in data. 
The model is defined by the configuration of the layers and the parameters of the layers. 
The architecture of a model defines the way in which the layers are connected to each other.

The architecture of a model refers to its structural design, including the types, arrangement, and 
connections of its layers and components.

* VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was used to win the 2014 ImageNet competition. It is considered to be one of the excellent vision model architectures till date.

* MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network that is 53 layers deep. It is a very efficient model and is designed for mobile and embedded vision applications.
