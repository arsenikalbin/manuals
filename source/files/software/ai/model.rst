Model Architecture
==================

A model architecture is the choice of a machine learning algorithm along with the underlying structure 
or design of the machine learning model. Model architecture consists of layers of interconnected nodes 
or neurons, where each layer of the model performs a specific function, such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, or prediction.

Popular model architectures include decision trees for smaller datasets, and deep neural networks for larger datasets, 
including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers.

**Some popular model architectures:**

* VGG-16 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that was used to win the 2014 ImageNet competition. 
  It is considered to be one of the excellent vision model architectures till date.

* YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that is extremely fast and 
  accurate. It is a single-stage object detection model that goes straight from image pixels to bounding box coordinates 
  and class probabilities in one pass.

* MobileNetV2 is a convolutional neural network that is 53 layers deep. It is a very efficient model and is designed 
  for mobile and embedded vision applications.
