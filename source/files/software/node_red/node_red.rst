Node-RED
========
Low-code programming for event-driven applications.
Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.

It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette 
that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click. 

Node-RED is built on Node.js, taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the 
edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the Raspberry Pi as well as in the cloud.

Developed by IBM Emerging Technology and the open source community.
