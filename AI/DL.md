# Deep Learning
deep learning algorithms can be regarded both as a sophisticated and mathematically complex evolution of  
machine learning algorithms.  

describes algorithms that analyze data with a logic structure similar to how a human would draw conclusions.  
This can happen both through supervised and unsupervised learning.  
To achieve this deep learning applications use a layered structure of algorithms called an artificial neural network (ANN).

### Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

Hidden layers are called hidden, because their values arenâ€™t directly observed in the training data (they are calculated during the training process).  
In simple terms, the hidden layers are calculated values used by the network to make predictions.
