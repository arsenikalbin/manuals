# Behavior tree
is a mathematical model of plan execution used in computer science, robotics, control systems and video games. 
- Behavior trees describe switchings between a finite set of tasks in a modular fashion. 
- Their strength comes from their ability to create very complex  tasks composed of simple tasks, 
  without worrying how the simple tasks are implemented.
- Behavior trees present some similarities to hierarchical state machines with the key difference 
  that the main building block of a behavior is a task rather than a state
