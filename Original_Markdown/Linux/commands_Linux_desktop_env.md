![Liux Windowing System](../images/linux_windowing_system.png)

- X windows system is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems. 
- "X11" refers to a version pf the X protocol. Xorg is an open source implementation of X.
- Display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output  
  of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other.  
- `xinit` - allows a user to manually start an Xorg display server. It is used to initialize the Xorg display server   
            and provide a connection for remote X clients (e.g. `xinit /usr/bin/xfce4-session -- :1` - start Xorg display server   
            and launch Xfce4 desktop environment on display :1)  
- Wayland is a comminication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients.  
  Wayland is a replacement for the X windows system.  
  Display servers using the Wayland protocol are called compositors because they also act  
  as compositing window managers.
- To check which display server is running use `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE` (if output is x11 - Xorg is running,   
  if output is wayland - Wayland is running)  
- Display manager (e.g. GDM, LightDM) is a program that starts the display server, launches the desktop, and manages   
                 user authentication. Is not a part of the desktop environment.  
  `cat /etc/X11/default-display-manager` - check which display manager is running
- Session manager is a program that starts the desktop environment and manages its sessions (e.g. gnome-session, startxfce4)
- `startxfce4` - start Xfce4 desktop environment. startxfce4 is a script responsible for starting an Xfce session.  
               It runs xinit passing the file specified in the FILES subsection as an argument  
               You  may  want  to  modify  the  default  xinitrc  file.  In  order  to  do   that,   copy  
               /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc to ~/.config/xfce4/xinitrc and modify that file.  
- Window manager is a program that draws the frames around windows and allows the user to move, resize and close them.  
               Is a part of the desktop environment.  
- Firstly display manager starts the display server, then session manager starts the desktop environment,  
  and then window manager starts the window manager.  
- VcXsrv is an open source display server for Microsoft Windows operating systems (Windows X-server based on the xorg git sources).  
  It allows you to start a display server on your Windows system and then connect to it from your Linux system  
  (This package allows a GUI to be started from a WSL distribution)  
- `xeyes` - show a pair of eyes that will follow the mouse pointer around the screen - this is a part of X11 utilities  
- `xhost +` - allow any user to connect to the X server (not recommended)
- ~/.Xauthority - file that contains the credentials in cookies used to authenticate the user to the server, if this file is deleted 
                  then the user will not be able to log in to the X server. It will be recreated next time the user logs in.
- `xauth list` - list the cookies in the user's ~/.Xauthority file
- /etc/X11/Xsession - script that starts X11 session
  X session is a collection of X clients (applications) and an X server (display server). 
- `startx` - start X11 session (startx is a script responsible for starting an X session. It runs xinit passing the file specified  
             in the FILES subsection as an argument) (e.g. `startx /usr/bin/xfce4-session` - start Xfce4 desktop environment)
             startx is just a shell script wrapper around xinit

### TigerVNC and TightVNC
- TigerVNC adds encryption for all supported operating systems and not just Linux. Conversely, TightVNC has features that  
- TigerVNC doesn't have, such as file transfers
- Xvnc is the X VNC (Virtual Network Computing) server. It is based on a standard X server, but it has a "virtual" screen rather  
  than a physical one. X applications display themselves on it as if it were a normal X display, but they can only be accessed  
  via a VNC viewer - see `man Xvnc` for more information  
- /etc/X11/Xvnc-session - script that starts Xvnc server
- `sudo apt install tigervnc-standalone-server` - install TigerVNC
- `sudo apt install tightvncserver` - install TightVNC
- `vncserver` - start VNC server
- `vncserver -kill :<display_number>` - stop VNC server
- `vncserver -list` - list all running VNC servers

- Lightweight Desktop to use with VNC server: Xfce4  
- `sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies` - install Xfce4 (xfce4-goodies - additional plugins for Xfce4)
