# Odometry
is the use of data from motion sensors to estimate change in position over time. It is used in robotics  
by some legged or wheeled robots to estimate their position relative to a starting location.

> Origin of word "odometry": Greek hodos (way) + metron (measure).

VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry) is a method to estimate the pose of a camera in real-time. It uses a 
combination of a camera and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to estimate the pose of the camera.
