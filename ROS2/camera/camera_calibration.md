Camera calibration is the process of estimating the intrinsic, extrinsic, and distortion parameters of a camera.

The ***intrinsic*** parameters deal with the camera's internal characteristics, such as, its focal length, skew, distortion, and image center.  
The ***extrinsic*** parameters deal with the camera's position and orientation in the world.

The ***distortion*** parameters deal with the lens distortion of the camera.

To calibrate a camera, we need to take pictures of a calibration pattern from different angles and orientations.

***Lens distortion*** is caused by the lens of the camera. It causes straight lines to appear curved.
