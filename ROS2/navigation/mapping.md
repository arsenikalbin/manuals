# Topological maps 
focus on the spatial relationships and connectivity between different locations, emphasizing the relative positions of features  
rather than their precise geographic coordinates. These maps are often used in navigation systems  and robotics to plan  
efficient routes and understand the layout of an area. They're handy when you care more about the connections between places  
than the exact distances.  
> Origin of word "topology": Greek topos (place) + logos (study).
