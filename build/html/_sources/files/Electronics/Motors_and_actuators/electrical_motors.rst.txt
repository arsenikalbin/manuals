DC motors (brushed)
===================
DC motor (brushed) is a motor that rotates when a DC voltage is applied to its terminals.

Servomotors
===========

A servomotor is a motor that can be controlled to rotate to a specific angle. Actually, it is a DC motor with a built-in feedback mechanism that controls the speed and position of the motor.

BLDC motors (brushless)
========================

To drive a BLDC motor, the :ref:`ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) <bldc_motor_drivers>` is used.
